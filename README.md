Mobile Money Transaction Analysis and Visualization
=====================================================

This repository contains two Python scripts, `process_data.py` and `visualize_data_v2.py`, designed to analyze and visualize mobile money transaction data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Required libraries: `xml.etree.ElementTree`, `re`, `pandas`, `sqlite3`, `streamlit`, and `plotly`
- A sample XML file containing mobile money transaction data (e.g., `sms-20250116123406.xml`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (assuming you have a `requirements.txt` file with the required libraries listed).
3. Make sure you have a sample XML file containing mobile money transaction data.

### Using the Scripts

#### `process_data.py`

This script processes the XML file and extracts relevant transaction data. To use it:

1. Place your XML file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script by executing `python process_data.py` in your terminal.
3. The script will generate a CSV file and a SQLite database containing the extracted transaction data.

#### `visualize_data_v2.py`

This script visualizes the transaction data using Streamlit and Plotly. To use it:

1. Make sure you have the SQLite database file generated by `process_data.py`.
2. Run the script by executing `streamlit run visualize_data_v2.py` in your terminal.
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to view the interactive dashboard.

## Customizing the Scripts

### `process_data.py`

You can customize the script by modifying the `parse_xml` and `extract_transaction_data` functions to suit your specific needs.

### `visualize_data_v2.py`

You can add SQL Queries that suit your specific needs and add more functions for visualization based on your specific needs.
If you need to, for instance see how much you have received from people as opposed to how much you have sent to people.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the scripts, please check the following:

- Make sure you have the required libraries installed.
- Ensure that your XML file is in the correct format and contains the required data.
- Check the script logs for any error messages.
